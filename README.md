## Overview
In this challenge we had to build a new and a bit tougher project with HTML & CSS

### The challenge 

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

Coding process on this one was fun. I practiced a lot with this project. We had a lot of containers headings and paragraphs to style. I gave it an original card look. It wasn't hard but I am moving and looking forward for the new challenges.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [VS Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### What I learned

Even though I knew most of the HTML & CSS needed for this project I still learnt some background properties I didn't knew. Obviously there is much more to learn and I am looking forward to it.
